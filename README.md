## IMPORTANT

This project doesn't carry any commercial value. One could just as easily use 
GuruFocus for a more comprehensive picture. I came up with this project based on 
my work tasks. I needed to obtain data from data providers and do something with 
it. Then I started seriously working with RabbitMQ, so I integrated it. I 
understand perfectly well that using a monolithic architecture in Go, one could 
use go channels instead of RabbitMQ. On another project, I needed to implement 
a subscription system through Stripe, so there is (or will be) a subscription 
here too. For the frontend, I'm using Angular 17 - although it would probably 
be easier to use HTMX and generate everything on the server... Plus, I've never 
written anything big in Golang before, so I'm just curious about it. What mistakes 
will I make, how to fix them, and how to avoid them in the future.

I enjoy setting myself challenging tasks that I haven't done before. So this 
project is my pet project where I practice, come up with new tasks, explore 
different approaches, and... make mistakes, fix them, forget to write tests, 
forget to write documentation, and so on. This project is free to copy. You can 
copy it, fix all the mistakes, and start your own startup, I don't mind :) I 
wish you good luck. This project's main task is not to launch by a certain date. 
The main task of this project is to work on this project. After all, the result 
is the experience of solving unusual tasks.


## Docs

I'm periodically fill documentation with ideas, workflows and technical 
explanations. Think of it like about devlog.
